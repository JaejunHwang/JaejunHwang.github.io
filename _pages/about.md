I am an Algorithm enginner at [GENGENAI](https://gengen.ai), focusing diffusion model for image generation. Before joining GENGENAI, I was a graduate student in the Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence integrated M.S. program at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr). I was a member of the [Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/) at POSTECH under [Minsu Cho](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/~mcho/). \
My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning, especially in generation model and temporal consistency.
If you are interested in my research projects, please feel free to contact me by clicking one of the icons below.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
